# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Backend Foundation - **Completed**

### Goal

Build the first working version of the Internship Application Tracker backend.

The backend provides a documented REST API that manages internship applications in memory. This phase established a clean Python project structure, request validation, error handling, dependency injection, and automated tests.

Persistent database storage is not included in this phase.

### Completed Deliverables

- A structured Python backend project
- A FastAPI application that starts locally
- A health-check endpoint
- An endpoint to create an internship application
- An endpoint to list all internship applications
- An endpoint to retrieve one internship application
- An endpoint to update an internship application
- An endpoint to delete an internship application
- Request and response validation
- HTTP `404` handling for unknown applications
- An isolated in-memory repository for automated tests
- Automated model and API tests
- Interactive OpenAPI documentation through Swagger
- Documentation explaining how to install, run, test, and use the backend locally

### Definition of Done

- [x] The FastAPI application starts locally without errors
- [x] `GET /health` returns HTTP `200`
- [x] An internship application can be created
- [x] All existing internship applications can be listed
- [x] A single application can be retrieved by its identifier
- [x] An existing application can be updated
- [x] An existing application can be deleted
- [x] Invalid request data produces a clear client error
- [x] Requesting an unknown application produces HTTP `404`
- [x] Application data remains available while the process is running
- [x] Automated tests verify the main API operations
- [x] All automated tests pass
- [x] The complete CRUD flow has been verified manually through Swagger
- [x] The local setup and start commands are documented

### Phase 1 Result

Phase 1 was completed with:

- A working in-memory CRUD API
- Six available HTTP endpoints
- Domain validation using Pydantic
- Repository dependency injection
- Automated test isolation
- 15 passing tests

Application data is intentionally temporary and is deleted when the backend process stops.
